# BrowserInformationJS
```
This is a very basic JavaScript project that can detect some information via the browser !
As you can see below this detects over 15+ things simply based on JS
You could easily add some PHP functions to track even more !
Note JS must be enabled in the browser to grab information
To grab information on the "GPU" openGL is also needed :)
```

## Potential changes 
```
Detect Ad-blocker (plugins)
Detect Tablets / Desktops
Parse the browser information to "Name"
Get some information on audio devices connected
Get information on current user permissions
```
